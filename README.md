This is a C++ language project that I completed while taking the CSE-250 Systems Programming course taught by Andrew Hughes at The University at Buffalo.

This is a program that creates a binary search tree and a priority queue. 
- For the BST, I was tasked with creating the addVal method which adds a value to the BST, along with the preToTree method that turns data into a tree by parsing it as preorder.
- For the PQ, I was tasked with creating a comparator and then the arrangeSeq method which places the PQ's data in order using it.

The code i've written can be found in two places: for the binary search tree, in a4-bst.hpp, and for the priority queue, in a4-pq.hpp. All other files were created by the professor.
